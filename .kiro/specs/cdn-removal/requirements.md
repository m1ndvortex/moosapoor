# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing external CDN dependencies from the gold shop web application and serving all required JavaScript and CSS libraries locally. The goal is to eliminate dependency on external CDNs (particularly Cloudflare CDN which is filtered in the user's country) while maintaining full functionality of the application including Persian calendar features, Bootstrap styling, and jQuery functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serve all JavaScript and CSS libraries locally, so that the application works without external CDN access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all CSS and JavaScript libraries SHALL be served from the local `/public` directory
2. WHEN external CDN services are blocked THEN the application SHALL continue to function normally
3. WHEN libraries are served locally THEN the application SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Persian calendar functionality to continue working, so that I can use date features without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN date inputs are used THEN moment.js and moment-jalaali SHALL function correctly from local files
2. WHEN Persian calendar features are accessed THEN they SHALL work identically to the CDN version
3. WHEN date formatting occurs THEN it SHALL maintain Persian calendar support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Bootstrap styling and components to work properly, so that the UI remains consistent and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN Bootstrap CSS SHALL be applied correctly from local files
2. WHEN Bootstrap JavaScript components are used THEN they SHALL function identically to the CDN version
3. WHEN responsive features are accessed THEN they SHALL work properly with local Bootstrap files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want jQuery functionality to continue working, so that all interactive features remain operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jQuery-dependent features are used THEN they SHALL function correctly with local jQuery
2. WHEN AJAX requests are made THEN they SHALL work properly with the local jQuery library
3. WHEN DOM manipulation occurs THEN it SHALL work identically to the CDN version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the exact same file versions, so that no compatibility issues arise from version mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN libraries are downloaded THEN they SHALL match the exact versions currently used from CDN
2. WHEN local files are referenced THEN they SHALL use the same integrity and functionality as CDN versions
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no functionality SHALL be broken or changed
